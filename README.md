# NixOS Configuration

Welcome to my personal NixOS configuration repository! Here you'll find everything needed to set up my system just the way I like it. From system-wide settings to my home directory tweaks, it's all here.

## Getting Started

To get up and running, follow these steps:

Clone the repository with the --recursive flag to ensure all submodules are included:

```bash Copy code
git clone --recursive https://github.com/joaonotfound/nixos-configuration.git
```

## Makefile Flags

- `make system`: Use this command to compile the system configuration.
- `make home`: Use this command to compile the home manager configuration.

And that's it! Enjoy exploring my NixOS setup. Feel free to customize it to make it your own. Cheers! 🚀
